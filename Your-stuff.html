                            hello womanman, happy birthday
let me start off by saying that I'm proud of u for a lot of things that you've done in the last 6 months (ykwim). Thank you for making me believe that nu can occasionally house cool people, even a connotation of dory ( fROm fInDInG dOrY) at times. I'm glad i chose u for nanoepl, honestly wouldn't have done it without you my güò©
looking forward to your next rant, i always derive ironic pleasure from u talking about the tantalizing realities of the world. thnku4exist, now go ahead and say thank you in broken-texts

                            I never thought I'll get myself to write this for you cuz ofc we haven't spoken much for me to know you well. But from what I've heard about you from Pandey and other guys since the beginning has always made me want to get to know you better as a person. And maybe writing this for your birthday is one step closer to that. I know I might be the strangest person you have ever met cuz I never made the first move to strike a conversation with you even though I had so many opportunities, but please know that you won't be disappointed once we FINALLY start getting to know each other, altho I hope my coy inner self allows me to do that soon. I have noticed many things which are common between us so get ready to have many awkwardly fun conversations with me :) Happiest Birthday Khushi! Eat loads of pizzas and send some for us.

Yet another birthday we're stuck here. But despite that, I love seeing the progress you've been making. TWENTY THOUSAND INTERNSHIP üò≠, MEREKO BHI DEDE PAISE. But yes even apart from that lmao.
Despite all the shitshows, hope you're good this birthday.
And hope everything gets back to normal soon, whatever that is.
Baaki all the best, here's to hopefully a great year ahead, happy birthday.
